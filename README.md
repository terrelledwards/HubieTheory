# Hubie_Brown_Theory_Test

The goal of this project is to test Hubie Brown's theory that is outlined here: https://www.breakthroughbasketball.com/stats/using-shot-charts.html#:~:text=On%20the%20shot%20chart%2C%20you,the%20page%20without%20the%20circle.

Using the Basketball-Reference-Scraper-API detailed here: https://github.com/vishaalagartha/basketball_reference_scraper/blob/master/API.md we will access the requisite shot chart data for each player to calculate their FG% from the different shooting zones outlined by Hubie Brown.
